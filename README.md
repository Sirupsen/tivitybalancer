# tivitybalancer

You have things you'd like to do more often on a recurring schedule? Having a
task every day, week or month doesn't really cut it? Do you have a hard time
starting on something, let alone choosing what productive task it should be?

Let `tivitybalancer` pick it for you. This extension allows you to configure a
list of productive websites. When you click the button, it sends you to a random
one of them! [Zeigernik effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeigarnik_effect)
kicks in, and üôè

Install by downloading the [extension
file](https://github.com/Sirupsen/tivitybalancer/raw/master/tivitybalancer.crx)
and open it with Chrome.

Examples of tasks well-suited for `trivitybalancer`. I'd recommend that they are
tasks where you can make progress in 10-25m, otherwise you're going to end up
dreading clicking it..

* Page that creates a new article on your blog
* `thebrowser.com` for an amazing article, or other sites you like for reading
* Your Pocket reading queue
* Personal projects
* News site in a foreign language
* Updating potentially out-of-date documents
* Write something about your week
